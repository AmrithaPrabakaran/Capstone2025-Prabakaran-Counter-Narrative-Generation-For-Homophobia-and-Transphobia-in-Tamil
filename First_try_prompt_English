Step 3: Debate Discussion Plan
Scenario:

Main Team: Aravind (Cultural), Mugilan (Scientific), Sanjay (Historical)

Critic: Supports “Gay men aren’t men.”

Round 1
Critic:
“Gay men aren’t real men; men should only be attracted to women.”

Aravind (Cultural):
“Manhood is about honesty and responsibility toward family and society, not about who you love.”

Mugilan (Scientific):
“Research confirms sexual orientation is a natural human trait and doesn’t alter someone’s gender.”

Sanjay (Historical):
“Ancient Tamil literature and Indian history celebrate many forms of love, including same-sex love.”

Round 2
Critic:
“Men are supposed to show strength; gay men act feminine and weak.”

Aravind (Cultural):
“Strength is in supporting loved ones and living truthfully, not in conforming to stereotypes.”

Mugilan (Scientific):
“Studies show masculinity and femininity are social constructs; orientation doesn’t dictate behavior.”

Sanjay (Historical):
“Many respected warriors and poets in history were also in same-sex relationships; it didn’t diminish them.”

Round 3
Critic:
“This is a modern trend; tradition never accepted it.”

Aravind (Cultural):
“Tradition values harmony and compassion; love has always been part of our culture.”

Mugilan (Scientific):
“This is not modern; same-sex attraction has existed in all cultures and eras.”

Sanjay (Historical):
“Our own texts mention diverse love stories; tradition is richer than what we assume.”

Abstract Plan (Consensus)
Redefine masculinity: Masculinity is about responsibility, compassion, and integrity — not sexual orientation.

Scientific evidence: Sexual orientation is natural and does not affect one’s gender identity.

Cultural and historical roots: Diverse love forms, including same-sex love, are present in history and tradition.

Step 4: Plan Distillation
Masculinity isn’t tied to whom you love.

Science shows sexual orientation is natural.

History and culture have always included diverse love.

Step 5: Final Counter Narrative (English)
“Being gay doesn’t make someone less of a man; masculinity is about integrity and compassion, and love has always taken many forms across history and culture.”
